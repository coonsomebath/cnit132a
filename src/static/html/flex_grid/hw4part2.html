        /* 
            In the browser’s developer tools, when you hover over a flex item, 
            you might see a diagonal shaded line and an arrow. 
            Here’s what they represent:

            Diagonal Shaded Line: This line represents the available space where the element can expand. 
                It shows the initial size of the flex item (set by flex-basis or the actual content) before 
                any remaining space is distributed among the flex items according to their flex-grow and flex-shrink values.
                If the flex item is set to a certain value but doesn’t take up the full size 
                (because the container’s size along the main axis isn’t sufficient for the flex items in it), 
                this shaded area appears to show the complete size of the flex item if there were space for it.
            
            Arrow: The arrow shows the direction in which the flex item grows or shrinks.
                It will show horizontally if the flex-direction was set to row and vertically 
                if it is set to column. The arrow appears when there is no space for an item to take 
                its full size in a flex layout in the direction of the main axis.
            
            These visual aids can be very helpful when debugging layout issues with flexbox in CSS. 
            They allow you to see how space is being distributed among flex items and how those 
            items are growing and shrinking to fill that space.
