                <h2>An image is an image, right?</h2>

                <p>
                    &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words.&quot;
                    This is a common saying that that pays homage to the power of images.
                    When you find yourself in a waiting room with a table full of magazines,
                    I would wager that most people would skim through the magazine and focus
                    mainly on the images and headlines. Images, at a glance, have the power to
                    engage our imagination and conjure emotions. If an average person opens
                    up a book and gets hit with a wall of text, that person will probably
                    put that book down. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A webpage is no exception. When it loads, one&apos;s eyes naturally darts
                    around the viewport to take in the images and possibly the headlines.
                    People are impatient and want things fast and they want it now. With
                    so many options available on the internet, it is hard to hold their
                    attention. When a webpage loads, you expect the webpage to work flawlessly.
                    You do not want to see partial images in the process of downloading. And you
                    will probably get really annoyed if you started to read some text and
                    suddenly the layout shifts on you causing you to lose sight of the words 
                    you were reading. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Image optimization helps to mitigate these issues. The problem with images
                    is that there are so many variations and each with their own use case. In 
                    addition, technology is evolving so fast. We now have very powerful cameras 
                    in our pockets that we can weld in a moment's time. And these cameras are 
                    capable of capturing ultra high resolution images. In the quest to 
                    monopolize the market, companies are constantly trying to sell more powerful 
                    image capabilities to consumers with no end in sight. How much resolution 
                    do you need really?  
                </p>

                <h2>Can of worms</h2>

                <p>
                    Ultra high resolution images look great, but their file size are huge. 
                    This is not a problem if you are viewing these images on your local
                    device because you are on a wired connection. Here the wires are the 
                    circuits in your hardware, where there is negligible resistance. 
                    This is opposed to say a mobile device that receives data through
                    the air via cellular towers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Think mobile first" is a mantra that technologist like to utter. This
                    is for good reason. How many times do you touch your mobile device in
                    a day in comparison to a laptop or desktop? The statistic is clear, it
                    is a lot. And in some parts of the world, people are leap frogging over 
                    &quot;traditional phones&quot; and graduating directly to mobile devices.
                    However, their infrastructure may not be as modern as in a first world
                    market. Rates of transmission will be different on a 2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G
                    infrastructure. In addition, not all users have generous data plans and
                    may have to pay a premium in terms of money and or data throttling. When
                    you think mobile first, you become cognizant of some of these issues and 
                    you construct your webpage in a way to alleviate some of the drag.

                <h2>What can I do?</h2>

                <p>
                    An easy way to unclog a data bottle neck is to optimize the images on 
                    your website. Firstly, let&apos;s address the layout shift issue. 
                    When a browser loads a html webpage, it will read the document top 
                    to bottom and render or download the assets it needs to render the page.
                    If you do not set the width and height attributes of an image tag, the
                    browser will not know how much room to reserve for the image and so it 
                    does not allocate any real estate for it. When the image finishes
                    downloading, the browser will then know the size and will then insert
                    the image into its container; this will cause a reflow and thus the
                    layout shift issue. Specifying the width and height of an image tag
                    will reserve the appropriate dimension and prevent the layout shift
                    from occurring and thus improving the user&apos;s experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you specify the width and height of an image tag, you know the
                    maximum dimensions of the image that you need. With this knowledge,
                    you can now adjust the width and height of your original image to
                    match the image container. Just setting the width and height of the
                    image tag container does not modify the image&apos;s innate dimension,
                    as shown in Fig 1, the original image. In Fig 4, 
                    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pillow/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pillow</a>
                    was used to reduce the image&apos;s width to match the container width, 560px.
                    This one adjustment reduced the size of the file by 96%. If for some reason
                    you did not want to reduce the image&apos;s size, you can opt to reduce
                    the image&apos;s quality. In Fig 3, 
                    <a href="https://imagecompressor.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Optimizilla</a>
                    was used to reduce the quality to 65% of the original. This led to a 92% reduction
                    in the file&apos;s size. However, using 
                    <a href="https://squoosh.app/editor" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Squoosh</a>
                    to adjust both the dimension and quality, the file size was reduced by 99.57% of the original size, as
                    shown in Fig 13. This file size reduction means that less data needs to be transferred over the
                    network, which reduced the download time by 99.76% to just 6ms for the jpeg file, as opposed to
                    2,480ms for the unoptimized image.                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to adjusting dimension and quality, you can also change the compression algorithm or file
                    format type. Thus far, we have been talking about jpeg files. We can also use the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">png</a> 
                    and 
                    <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">webp</a> 
                    formats/algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Portable network graphics(png) is lossless technology. It means that you can compress the image without
                    losing data and thus quality, unlike the jpeg technology. Using Squoosh, a 93.6% reduction in file 
                    size was possible. This was not the most optimal solution, but if you need to retain 100% quality,
                    png is a reasonable option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Webp has 97.06% support among global browsers, as compared to the 98.56% that is enjoyed by the 
                    png format. It supports both lossy and lossless compression and was designed to be a replacement
                    for jpeg, png, and gif file formats. Of the optimization methods used for testing, webp was by far
                    the most optimal. It achieved a 99.66% reduction in file size and a 99.92% reduction in
                    download time, as shown in the table or Fig 15. If you are targeting modern browsers, webp is the 
                    way to go. You can always add a fallback to another file format using the srcset attribute or 
                    the picture element if you need wider browser support.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to the above optimizations, you can also add the loading=lazy attribute and value onto the
                    img tag. This will enable a just-in-time downloading scheme to prevent premature downloading of images
                    when they are not in view.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With these optimizations, you can increase the efficiency of your website. Your webpage will download
                    faster. It will be ranked higher under Google's SEO criteria. It will consume less resources, in terms 
                    of money, energy, and time.
