            <h1>About</h1>
        
            <p>
                This website was constructed to host the portfolio of assignments for 
                CNIT 132A: Advanced HTML & CSS from 
                City College of San Francisco
                under the guidance of Professor Da Silva.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & discretionary
                standalone Vue3 components. The decision not to create a Single Page
                Application was influenced by the desire to streamline the Professor's
                workflow.
            </p>
