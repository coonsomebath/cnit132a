            <h2>What are you trying to convey?</h2>

            <p>
                I think this is an important question that you need to ask when you have
                a website that is informational in nature. For this type of content, 
                Google will rank such a webpage higher if it contains unique insights
                and shows characteristics of being authoritative in its niche. Users are
                likely to feel the same way and other content creators will link to these
                webpages because they want to recommend great content to their audience
                to drive value as they try to delight them.

            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker" rel="noopener external" target="_blank">
                    Peter Drucker, a management consultant and scholar,
                </a> 
                believes that to effectively manage something, you need to
                measure it. It's hard to determine the objective effectiveness of some 
                course of action if you do not have a concrete reference point.
                <abbr title="Google Analytics 4">GA4</abbr>
                has many metrics that it captures that you can use that will help you with
                your analysis of webpage performance. Some of the metrics we will be covering
                will be 
                <strong>Views per user</strong>, 
                <strong>Sessions per user</strong>, 
                <strong>Average engagement time</strong>, 
                and 
                <strong>Average session duration</strong>. 

                In this discussion, the metrics will be in relation to the &quot;Page path and
                screen class&quot; dimension analysis. We will observe which webpages users
                visited most often and how long they stayed engaged with the content. You
                can view the analytics data with the following link to the pdf file:
                <a href="src/static/data/ga4/ga4_final_report.pdf">
                    Google Analytics 4 data measuring webpage interest
                </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's briefly define the metrics that help to quantify our observation of interest.

                A View is what it sounds like; it&apos;s when a view event is triggered and logged
                documenting when the user views a particular webpage. Recall, we are focusing on 
                page path i.e. particular webpages within the website. A user is a device that has
                been assigned a unique device ID by the GA4 tag embedded in the html source code.
                A person may access your website from different devices and thus a person can 
                represent multiple users under this identification mechanism. <strong>Views per user</strong>
                measures how many times, on average, a webpage has been viewed by a user.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Session is logged when a user visits your website. A page view is one of several
                events that will trigger a logged session by a user. This differs from the previously
                discussed View in that a Session is not measuring a viewed page, but rather is measuring
                a session, a visit to the website, under the technical definition. In addition, a session
                times out after thirty minutes of inactivity. If a user continues activity after
                the timeout, it will be considered a different session. It may be possible to
                adjust this default timeout duration to accommodate your site&apos;s characteristics.
                <strong>Sessions per user</strong> measures how many times, more specifically, how many sessions a
                user, on average, has with your website over the analysis period. In other words, 
                how often do they visit and engage with your website. When we apply this metric to
                a particular path, like in our dimensional analysis of "Page path and screen class",
                it suggests how many times, on average, the user re-visits a path during a collection
                of their sessions set. 
                It is like asking, &quot;Does a user find the information interesting enough to go back 
                to that same webpage to revisit the information in a subsequent session?&quot; This is
                different from a view in that a user can view a page multiple times during a session and
                multiple views will be documented, but sessions per user will capture if the user viewed
                that page at all during a session. In other words, it&apos;s like the user saying, 
                &quot;I already visited that page last time, I&apos;m done with it, no need to 
                look at it again&quot; or &quot;I visited that page last time, but I want to see if
                anything changed, if there is updated information&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to a user visiting your website, it is also important for you to retain their
                attention. The whole point of having a website is to provide a product or service that
                a user finds valuable and worth their time or resources. We can use Average engagement
                time and Average session duration to get an idea of the perceived value a user is
                getting from your digital property. <strong>Average engagement time</strong> is 
                the amount of time a user is spending on your website and is actively interacting with
                it as opposed to just having the webpage open in one of the user&apos;s browser tab.
                With respect to Page path and screen class, average engagement time measures how 
                much time a user is spending on a particular webpage. This is opposed to
                <strong>Average session duration</strong>, which measures how much time a user is
                spending on your website during one of their sessions. Again with respect to a
                webpage, it tells you how much time the user is spending on your website during one
                of their average sessions where they also visited that particular path/page. It
                does not measure how much time a user is spending on a particular page; it measures
                the duration the user spent on the website where they landed on that page as well
                and had engaged with it.

            <h2>CSS Animations</h2>

            <p>
                In Google Analytics 4, a View is the number of times a page has been landed on
                by the user. View per user measures aggregate views over the analysis period,
                which is from March 1 - May, 18 2024, divided by the number of Users the site
                had over that same period. The horizontal bar chart(in the linked pdf) shows the 
                top 5 urls viewed were for the landing page(68), the animations page(30), 
                the src page(25), the contact page(12), then the about page(11). 
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of views per user, the landing page had 2.96, the animations page had
                2.50, the src page had 2.08, the contact page had 1.20, and the about page had
                2.20. The landing page(index.html) is expected to have the highest number of
                views given that it provides navigation services to the other pages.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Users found the animations page the most interesting page over the period.
                However, this animations page is really just a landing page for the assignment,
                which had two parts and thus two links, CSS Animations and @container CSS at-rule.
                I had failed to anticipate the need to measure engagement time on those individual
                webpages and so I did not add the Google tag to those pages. However, this navigation
                page saw an Average engagement time of 16 seconds and and Average session duration of
                2 minutes and 12 seconds. Thus on average, the user spent 16 seconds on that navigation
                page and spent on average 2min 12sec with the website where the animation landing page
                was one of the routes visited. To improve the quality of the observation, I would go 
                back and add the GA4 tag to the animation and css shapes webpages to measure the 
                events there as well to get a better understanding of user behavior. However
                even with incomplete visibility, the average duration suggests that most people
                only look at results and are not concerned with implementation. People are busy, 
                curious, but do not find the content valuable enough to stick around.

        <section>
            <h2>Src Directory</h2>
            <p>
                Ignoring the landing page(index.html), the source page was the second most visited
                path. This path was not intended to be viewed by the user. It was exposed because
                the href attribute was set to an empty string on an anchor tag. So when a user 
                clicked on the anchor tag, the browser would show the src directory and its 
                subdirectories and files. The directory had an average engagement time of 15sec 
                and an average session duration of 2m 31s. The average engagement time suggests 
                that people were curious enough to spend some time to look around at the different
                directories and files. This is understandable behavior; it is like walking down a
                path and finding a mysterious trail. I would feel adventurous and explore the
                path myself. The exploration of this path is not desireable and the report provides
                feedback to the researcher to make them aware of the condition and they can 
                take corrective action to close the vulnerability.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Contact Page</h2>
            <p>
                The last path we will be covering is the contact page. This page has an average
                engagement time of 5s and an average session duration of 1m 40s. The average
                engagement time of 5s was expected to be very short because the content of that
                page is very minimal. It consists of only a thank you message and an email link.
                Personally, five seconds seems kind of a long time to spend on the page given
                the lack of content. It suggest to me that the user may have opened the developer
                tools to quickly look at the html of the email link. With Views per user of 1.20
                and sessions per user of 1.10, it suggests that people did not bother to check back 
                on the webpage in subsequent sessions. This suggests to me that when creating a
                webpage, one should make extra effort to create more content on the page to prevent
                a user from drawing the conclusion that the page will always be sparse and that
                there is no need to check it again in the future because there is 
                &quot;noting there&quot;.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Frequency of Interest</h2>
            <p>
                The last observation we will cover has to do with when users tend to visit the
                website. In the line plot, which can be viewed in the linked pdf above, there
                is a clear trend with respect to spikes of user traffic. Users tend to visit
                the website on Fridays, but mostly Saturdays. It may be possible that users
                have finished their homework and may want to see how others have solved the
                same assignment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There were also anomalous spikes of traffic in May. This coincides with the
                animations homework assignment. This assignment was challenging and it is
                possible that people wanted to see how others approached the solution.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Analytical tools such a Google Analytics 4 is an important tool to provide insight into
                user behavior and website performance metrics. What interests you and what interests
                the user can be very different. It can be very unproductive to assume that your
                interest will align with the average user. It is always a good idea to use objective
                analytical methods and tools to observe facts as opposed to going on intuition.
                Intuition might work well for some individuals who are truly mavens, but this is
                the exception and not the rule. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the suggestive information of the line plot, bar chart, and table, it suggests
                to me that one can improve the analytics data by giving the audience what they want
                and when they want it. The content of the website should focus on challenging
                material and unexpected finds that may lead to an adventure. Furthermore, that
                content should be available on weekends and when the content is challenging, it should
                be available earlier and as soon as possible.
